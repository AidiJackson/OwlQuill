### Understanding Scenes
A **Scene** is a roleplay thread within a Realm. Think of it as a specific story or interaction happening in that world.

Example scenes:
- "The Dark Forest" - Characters exploring a mysterious forest
- "The Grand Ball" - A formal social event
- "The Tavern Brawl" - An action scene

### Creating a Scene
1. Navigate to a Realm you're a member of
2. Click **+ New Scene**
3. Provide a title and description
4. The scene is now ready for posts!

### Posting in a Scene
1. Enter a scene from the Realm page
2. Click **+ New Post**
3. Write your content
4. Choose a post type:
   - **IC (In-Character)**: Roleplay as your character
   - **OOC (Out-of-Character)**: Player commentary
   - **Narration**: Scene-setting or storytelling
5. Optionally select which character is posting (for IC posts)
6. Click **Post**

### Post Type Examples

**IC (In-Character) Post**:
```
*Luna steps into the tavern, her cloak dripping with rain*
"Anyone seen a merchant around here? I've got business to discuss."
```

**OOC Post**:
```
Hey everyone! I'll be away this weekend, so Luna won't be responding
until Monday. Feel free to continue without me!
```

**Narration Post**:
```
The storm outside grows fiercer. Thunder rumbles, shaking the windows
of the old tavern. The fireplace struggles to stay lit as wind howls
through the cracks in the walls.
```
