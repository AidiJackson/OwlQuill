You are Replit Agent working in repo AidiJackson/OwlQuill on branch feature/profile-redesign.
Goal: implement the Profile page to match the provided Figma-generated UserProfileView.tsx as close to exact as possible.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

Do not change architecture or project structure.
No new frameworks, no port changes, no workflow changes, no route system rewrite.

Only the Profile view gets the Figma “full-width” experience.
All other pages keep existing sidebar/layout.

Do not invent UI. Do not “interpret”.
UserProfileView.tsx is the source of truth for layout, spacing, and structure.

Do not paste the entire reference file into OwlQuill unchanged.
Port the layout into OwlQuill using existing patterns and components, but the result must look the same.

No secrets printed. No .env committed.

WHAT YOU MUST IMPLEMENT (MATCH Figma)

A) Profile page must fill the screen width (hero first impression)

Cover banner spans full available width on the Profile view

Avatar overlaps cover and is positioned to the right side like the reference

Action buttons cluster matches the reference placement (Message/Follow/Share or equivalents)

Stats row matches placement (Posts/Characters/Realms/Followers)

B) Sidebar must NOT be visible on Profile page

Implement a Profile-only layout override (do not alter global layout for other pages).

The Profile view should have the top icon bar (or equivalent) as per reference.

C) Tabs must match the reference file

Use the exact tab labels/ordering present in UserProfileView.tsx

Timeline default tab

Empty states for other tabs must look like reference

D) Data wiring

Use existing frontend API client methods:

getUserProfile(username)

getUserTimeline(username, limit)

Profile header uses getUserProfile

Timeline uses getUserTimeline and renders mixed items:

type=post → reuse existing post card + reactions/comments where available (but keep styling consistent)

type=scene → render a scene card matching reference style, link to /scenes/:id

E) Composer

If the reference file includes a composer on Timeline, include it.

Posting functionality can remain disabled unless OwlQuill already supports creating posts cleanly without hacks.

Do NOT silently post to Commons “under the hood” unless explicitly shown in the reference.

FILE SCOPE (ONLY TOUCH THESE UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY)

frontend/src/pages/UserProfile.tsx (main implementation)

frontend/src/App.tsx (only if route needs adjustment; keep /u/:username)

frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx (only for Profile link target or to allow hiding sidebar on Profile route)

Add one new component if needed for the profile-only chrome:

frontend/src/components/Profile/ProfileLayout.tsx (preferred)

DELIVERABLES

The profile at /u/:username visually matches UserProfileView.tsx:

full-width cover

avatar right aligned

no sidebar on profile

tabs + timeline layout match

No regressions: Home, Realms, Scenes, /profile settings page still work.

Run:

npx tsc --noEmit

npx vite build

Create a single commit with message:
Profile: Figma-exact home base layout (profile-only chrome)

STOP CONDITIONS

If you cannot reliably match layout due to missing shared UI components, stop and report:

what is missing

what you need from Aidan
Do not “approximate.”
